                            I focus mostly on web design but that doesn't mean I can't do native
                            apps. I do front and backend work, I am most familiar with the MEAN stack, but also know enough
                             about PHP and MySQL as well.

                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is Daan Henke, I am a 16 year old guy and I live in the Netherlands.<br>
                    I have been experimenting / tinkering with programming since I was about 7 or 8 years old.
                    I like web technologies the most since they are not platform dependent and are so different
                    to work with than other technologies. I like working on front end design just as much as I
                    like back end development.</p>

            <div class="panel-body center">
                <h2>Technical details</h2>
                <p>My back ends are mostly MEAN stacks (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angularjs, NodeJS), I use EJS to serve
                web pages but I rarely pump any variables to the pages via EJS. I like RESTFull API's better since they
                can update the page without reloading it. And they ofcourse also give a nice place for other people to
                mine certain information from your website.</p>
                <p>My front ends use Bootstrap to make good looking designs and AngularJS / RESTFull calls to update
                themselfs without the user even noticing that they are connected with a back end.</p>

                <h2>How do I work?</h2>
                <p>As soon as you contact me for a job I like to get in touch with you and hear exactly how you
                want your website to function and look. We will create a mind map which will function as the skeleton
                of your website. As soon as the mind map is done and I know how big the project is we can start negotiating
                about the pricing. When that is done I will start working on the website</p>
                <p>While I'm working I will regularly supply you with updates about the project. I often have my 'test server'
                accessible to external computers meaning you can browse the website while I'm building it. This way if you
                don't like how something is done you can comment on it and we will discuss how we can change it for the better</p>
